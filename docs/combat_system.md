# The Last Centaur - Combat System Guide

## Overview

The Elemental Affinity Combat System in The Last Centaur offers strategic depth through elemental types, status effects, and terrain bonuses. This guide will help you understand how to effectively engage in combat and defeat your enemies, including the formidable Shadow Centaur.

## Combat Basics

Combat in The Last Centaur is turn-based. When you encounter an enemy, you'll take turns attacking each other until one of you is defeated. The basic combat commands are:

- `attack [enemy] [element]` - Attack an enemy with a specified elemental type
- `defend` - Increase your defense for this turn
- `dodge` - Increase your chance to evade attacks for this turn
- `special` - Use a path-specific special ability
- `use [item]` - Use an item from your inventory during combat

## Elemental Types

There are seven elemental types in the game, each with strengths and weaknesses:

| Element  | Strong Against  | Weak Against | Status Effect |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Physical | Earth           | Air          | Bleed         |
