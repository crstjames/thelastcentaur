## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thelastcentaur.git
cd thelastcentaur
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Quick Start

1. Start the game server:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Testing the Game API

For development and testing purposes, you can interact with the game directly through the API. Follow these steps to test the core functionality:

### 1. Register a New User

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "testuser", "email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
```

**Note:** If you encounter a "Username already registered" error, try a different username.

### 2. Login to Get an Access Token

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login" \
  -F "username=testuser" \
  -F "password=password123"
```

This will return an access token in the format:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

**Important:** Save this token for use in subsequent requests. The token will be valid for 24 hours.

### 3. Create a Game Instance

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/game" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "My Adventure", "max_players": 1, "description": "A test game instance"}'
```

This will return a game instance ID that you'll need for further commands.

### 4. View the Game Map

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/game/YOUR_GAME_ID/map" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### 5. Look Around

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/game/YOUR_GAME_ID/command" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"command": "look"}'
```

### 6. Try Movement Commands

```bash
# Move north
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/game/YOUR_GAME_ID/command" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"command": "north"}'

# Other directions: south, east, west
```

### 7. Other Commands to Try

```bash
# Check inventory
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/game/YOUR_GAME_ID/command" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"command": "inventory"}'

# Attack an enemy
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/game/YOUR_GAME_ID/command" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"command": "attack wolf"}'
```

### Known Issues

- **Authentication Persistence**: This issue has been fixed by implementing a persistent secret key that is stored in `auth_secret.json`. If you encounter authentication issues after a server restart, make sure this file exists and has not been corrupted.
- **Port Conflicts**: If you see "Address already in use" errors, check for existing processes using port 8000 with `lsof -i :8000` and terminate them if needed.
